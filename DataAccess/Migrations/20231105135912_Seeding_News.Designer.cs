These are the endearing meerkats, among the most sociable and captivating residents of our zoo. In this blog post, we invite you to get to know some of our meerkats and gain insight into their captivating lives in the wild.</p> <p>Meerkats, a part of the mongoose family, hail from the southern regions of Africa. Their lives revolve around close-knit communities known as \"mobs,\" which can comprise up to 50 individuals. Within each mob, a dominant pair takes on the roles of breeding and leading, while other members play vital roles in raising offspring, foraging for sustenance, and guarding the territory.</p> <p>Communication is key in the meerkat world. They employ an array of vocalizations, gestures, and body postures to convey their thoughts and intentions. These tiny creatures exhibit a complex social structure, complete with distinct roles and responsibilities. For instance, some meerkats serve as sentries, diligently scanning the horizon for potential threats and swiftly alerting their comrades with alarm calls. Others engage in the crucial task of digging burrows, providing shelter and protection for the mob. Meerkats also engage in communal grooming, frolic together, and generously share their meals.</p> <p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of meerkats is their ability to thrive in challenging environments. They are well-suited to arid and semi-arid regions where water and vegetation are in short supply. Meerkats are highly adaptable to high temperatures and low oxygen levels. Their distinct dark patches around the eyes serve to reduce sun glare, and their elongated claws make them expert diggers, enabling them to unearth insects, their primary source of nourishment.</p> <p>While meerkats are not currently endangered, they do confront looming threats such as habitat loss, human-wildlife conflicts, and the impacts of climate change. At our zoo, we actively participate in conservation endeavors designed to safeguard meerkats and the habitats they call home. Additionally, we lend our support to research projects aimed at unraveling the mysteries of their behavior, ecology, and genetics.</p> <p>We trust that you've enjoyed this delightful glimpse into the world of our meerkats. During your next visit to our zoo, be sure to make a stop at their exhibit, and don't hesitate to introduce yourself. Meerkats are known for their warm reception to new faces and their enthusiasm for engaging with our visitors. For those who wish to take their support a step further, consider adopting a meerkat through our sponsorship program. Your contribution goes a long way in ensuring that our meerkats receive the best possible care. We extend our heartfelt thanks for your enduring interest and support for our remarkable animal residents.</p>",

Join us on this exclusive journey behind the scenes of our hippo habitat, where we reveal the secrets to keeping our massive friend happy and healthy.</p> <p>Hippos, despite their fearsome reputation, are herbivores, meaning they have a plant-based diet. But don't be fooled by their imposing size &ndash; they're not nibbling on a few leaves here and there. In fact, they can chow down on a staggering 150 pounds of food daily. That's a whole lot of salad!</p> <p>To ensure our hippo's well-being, we start each day by meticulously preparing a specialized mix of hay, alfalfa, fruits, and vegetables. The produce is expertly chopped into bite-sized morsels and placed into a sizeable bucket. We also incorporate vitamins and supplements to guarantee that he receives all the essential nutrients his body demands.</p> <p>Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for hippos, as excess pounds can lead to health complications. Regular weigh-ins are part of our routine, allowing us to fine-tune his diet as needed. Currently, our male hippo tips the scales at around 3,000 pounds, which is perfectly normal for his kind.</p> <p>Once the meal is ready, we head over to the hippo's enclosure and call out his name. He's usually quick to respond, eagerly anticipating feeding time. He's a sociable and inquisitive fellow, often greeting us with a comical yawn, which reveals his colossal teeth and jaw capable of crushing a watermelon in a single bite!</p> <p>The food is gently tossed into the water where he prefers to eat. He lowers his head beneath the surface, using his lips like a conveyor belt to scoop up the delicious morsels. Remarkably, he can hold his breath for up to five minutes, so he doesn't need to surface frequently. While dining, he can make some amusing noises, including grunts and snorts, and occasionally, a distinctive burp!</p> <p>Feeding a hippo is no small task, but it's undeniably rewarding. Witnessing his delight as he enjoys his meal and observing his growth and vitality is a source of immense joy for us. He's truly one of our beloved zoo residents, and we eagerly await your visit to meet this incredible creature up close. Come and see him soon!</p>",

It all began in 1898 when a dedicated group of animal enthusiasts founded the Zoological Society of London, with a noble mission &ndash; to assemble a collection of living animals for scientific study. In 1902, our doors opened to the public, unveiling an impressive display of over 600 animals from all corners of the world.</p> <p>Over the years, our zoo has blossomed and transformed, embracing new exhibits, state-of-the-art facilities, and innovative programs to meet the ever-evolving needs and interests of our visitors. Let's take a stroll through the pages of our history, highlighting some of our most significant milestones:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>1914:</strong> Pioneering the way, our zoo became the world's first to introduce a children's zoo, a place where youngsters could interact with farm animals and learn essential lessons about animal care.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1931:</strong> We unveiled our iconic Reptile House, housing a captivating array of snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles. This renowned institution made its mark in popular culture when it served as the setting for a scene in the first Harry Potter movie, where Harry discovered his unique ability to communicate with snakes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1957:</strong> A global sensation, our zoo welcomed its first giant panda, Chi Chi. This charismatic ambassador for wildlife conservation left an indelible mark and even became the symbol of the World Wildlife Fund, with her image gracing their logo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1976:</strong> Our commitment to conservation reached new heights with the establishment of our Conservation Programmes department. This visionary initiative coordinates research and conservation projects worldwide, working hand in hand with local communities and organizations to protect endangered species and their precious habitats, from gorillas in Africa to tigers in Asia and penguins in Antarctica.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1999:</strong> We introduced the immersive Rainforest Life exhibit, bringing the magic of the tropical rainforest to our visitors. Here, they can marvel at monkeys, sloths, armadillos, bats, birds, and a vibrant tapestry of insects.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>2007:</strong> The opening of our Gorilla Kingdom exhibit marked a significant step forward in animal welfare and conservation education. This expansive, naturalistic habitat is home to a group of western lowland gorillas, offering visitors a unique insight into the challenges facing these magnificent creatures in the wild.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>2016:</strong> Our Land of the Lions exhibit whisked visitors away to India's Gir Forest National Park, where Asiatic lions roam. This exhibit recreates the Indian landscape, complete with a replica Indian village, a train station, a temple ruin, and a high-tech lion lookout.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These are just a few of the captivating moments from our storied history. With each passing year, we remain dedicated to enhancing our standards for animal welfare, visitor experience, and conservation impact. This year, we proudly celebrate our 125th anniversary with an array of special events and activities throughout the year.</p> <p>If you're eager to join us in commemorating our zoo's anniversaries, explore our website for details on upcoming events.
